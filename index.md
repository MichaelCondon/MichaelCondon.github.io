## Portfolio
 Hey! I'm Michael. I'm 25 years old and fiercly passionate about System Administration and security. I have a wide variety of skills, with a specialisation in web technologies (C# MVC, HTML5 and CSS, a little NodeJS too!), Windows Automation using PowerShell, and information security. I'm currently exploring the world of Windows AD using Azure, and I have some minimal experience with Linux Systems as well.    
 I have worked for Microsoft Australia for 7 years, with 5 years of retail sales and 2 years of customer-facing support (helpdesk). I'm a (very) amatuer electronics hobbyist, with some experience using Micro-Controllers for basic home automation. You can contact me [Here](mailto:michaelcondon@outlook.com)

I developed a tool using PowerShell to interface with the Dynamics 365 Discovery API to pull data and generate basic graphs using the .NET charting libraries, and save them in a compressed image format for use in email reports.

A project I developed during my time at the University of Technology Sydney that utilises a Raspberry Pi, motion sensors, and a string of [Adafruit Neopixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) to dynamically light indoor and outdoor areas for safety.
